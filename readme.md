# About

The grey circle in the center represents a cannon, which fires the asteroids every couple of seconds.

Asteroids have random sizes, velocities, and directions.

When asteroids collide, they will turn red.

The collision detection function treats the asteroids as squares currently, so collisions aren't always accurately detected.
